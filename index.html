      <h1>Global Firepower</h1>
      <p>Since 2006, GlobalFirepower.com (GFP) has provided a unique analytical display of data concerning 142 modern military powers. 
        The GFP ranking is based on each nation's potential war-making capability across land, sea, and air fought by 
        conventional means. The results incorporate values related to manpower, equipment, natural resources, 
        finances, and geography represented by 50+ individual factors used in formulating the finalized GFP ranks - 
        which provide an interesting glimpse into an increasingly volatile global landscape where war seems all but an 
        inevitability.</p>

          <p>Victory in war ultimately comes down to available manpower that is Fit for Military Service, 
            a crucial factor in the GFP (Global Firepower) ranking as it represents the portion of a given population that is (theoretically) available to assist in a war effort. 
            This assumes able-bodied persons suitable for the fighting and material production involved in waging a long-running campaign. </p>

            A tank is an armoured fighting vehicle intended as a primary offensive weapon in front-line ground combat.
            Tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armour, and good battlefield mobility provided by tracks 
            and a powerful engine; usually their main armament is mounted in a turret. They are a mainstay of modern 
            20th and 21st century ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.
            Track-over-wheel designs are factored in from all branches of service (Army, Marines).

            A military aircraft is any fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft that is operated by a legal or 
            insurrectionary armed service of any type.
            Combat aircraft are designed to destroy enemy equipment or personnel using their own aircraft ordnance.
            Non-combat aircraft are not designed for combat as their primary function, but may carry weapons for self-defense. 
            These mainly operate in support roles.
            Fixed-wing and rotary-wing (helicopters) aircraft types are factored in from all branches of service (Air Force, 
            Army Aviation, Navy, Marine). </p>

              Rotorcraft forces are a critical component to any military power for their inherent flexibility and tactical 
              usefulness. Helicopters can cover a myriad of over-battlefield roles including Search & Rescue, medical 
              evacuation (MEDEVAC), 
              SpecialOps support, artillery-spotting, maritime patrol, and training.

            A nuclear warhead is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, 
            either fission (fission bomb) or a combination of fission and fusion reactions (thermonuclear bomb), 
            producing a nuclear explosion. Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small 
            amounts of matter.
            A nuclear device no larger than a conventional bomb can devastate an entire city by blast, fire, and radiation. 
            Since they are weapons of mass destruction, the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international 
            relations policy. Nuclear weapons have been deployed twice in war, by the United States against the Japanese 
            cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 during World War II.
